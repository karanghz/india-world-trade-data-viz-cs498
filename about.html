            <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Goal</span>
        </div>
        <div>In this narrative visualisation I have visualised India’s trade (export/import) with the rest of the world for the
            past 10 years. This visualisation aims to achieve three goals:</div>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <div>To throw light on the export/import balance across countries.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>To provide an insight into export/import trend for the past decade.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>To let the user explore the dataset across countries, commodities and years.</div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <div>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>To achieve these goals, I have used a
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Martini Glass </span>hybrid structure. This structure will allow me to present some key insights at the start
            and then let the user explore the vast dataset across three dimensions. </div>
        <div>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dataset </span>
        </div>
        <div>This dataset is a subset of the import/export data available at the official website of the Ministry of Commerce
            and Industry (Government of India):
            <a href="http://commerce-app.gov.in/eidb/default.asp">http://commerce-app.gov.in/eidb/default.asp</a>. The site provides data for every commodity imported and exported
            by India from every country in the world. </div>
        <div>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>I prepared this dataset as follows:</div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div>For the financial years 2008-09 to 2017-18, I downloaded the dataset for every commodity imported/exported
                    by India for each country. The data was downloaded using an R script. The dataset of each country contained
                    the following columns:
                </div>
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <div>Commodity Name</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div>Import value in million $</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div>Export value in million $</div>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                <div>I used an R script to stitch together the data for each country into a single dataset, which had the following
                    columns:
                </div>
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <div>Country</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div>Commodity Name</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div>Import value in million $</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div>Export value in million $</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div>The above dataset formed my main ‘Data Cube’</div>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <div>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>I used additional R scripts to query and summarise the 'Data Cube' for various graphs of the narrative visualisation.
            This was done to make sure the graphs load as fast as possible. </div>
        <div>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Scenes</span>
        </div>
        <div>The visualisation has a total of five scenes:</div>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <div>[Choropleth] Trade Balance with respect to each country</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>[Line chart] Annual Export/Import trend</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>[Area Chart] Annual Export/Import trend, split by country</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>[Area Chart] Annual Export/Import trend, split by commodity</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>[Line Chart] Annual Export/Import trend, by country and commodity</div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <div>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>The scenes appear in a linear order by simply scrolling the window. The height of each scene is adjusted such that
            the user can view almost one complete scene at a time. </div>
        <div>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>Since it was about India's world trade, I saw it fitting to have a world map (implemented as a choropleth) as my
            first scene. More information about this chart is provided at the end of this document. This first scene differs
            drastically from the rest of the scenes, which are all time trends over a decade. This was intentional as I wanted
            to
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div>first provide a high level summary of the entire decade before diving into the annual time trends.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>make sure proper visual context of the world is set in the mind of the user. In other words, I wanted to
                    make sure countries are not just names. </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>The scenes that come after the first one have a similar layout and structure:</div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div>Y axis is trade volume (continuous)</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>X axis is year (continuous)</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>The legend is on the right hand side</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>Tooltips for detail on demand</div>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>This ensures that the transition is as smooth as possible between the scenes. </div>
        <div>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>The last scene is a special one, which allows the user to visualise an import and export time trend for any combination
            of country and commodity. This scene is where the user can explore the
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">entire dataset</span> on which this visualisation is based.</div>
        <div>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Annotations</span>
        </div>
        <div>Annotations have been provided in two ways:</div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div>Brief text on top of each chart</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>Text annotations within the chart</div>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>The text annotations within the choropleth (scene #1) have been used to indicate countries from which India mostly
            only imports.
        </div>
        <div>The text annotations within the annual import/export trend chart (scene #2) have been provided to give some context
            of the various important events that occurred in the last decade and that may have impacted India's global trade. </div>
        <div>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>The rest of the scenes don't have text annotations within the chart. Also, the annotation are never cleared from
            the charts.
        </div>
        <div>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Parameters</span>
        </div>
        <div>The narrative visualisation has following parameters: </div>
        <div>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>

        <div>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>These parameters together allow the user to view an annual trend of export &amp; import values for any combination
            of country and commodity. </div>
        <div>
            <br/>

            <b>A Note About The Balance of Trade Chart (Scene #1)</b>
        </div>
        <div>The aim of the chart is to indicate India’s balance of trade - export vs import - with respect to each country in
            the world.
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>To do that I created new computed field called ‘import_vs_export’, which is derived for each country as follows:
        </div>
        <div>import_vs_export = ((export/(export + import)) - 0.5)*2 </div>
        <div>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>Here are some properties of the ‘import_vs_export' field, with respect to each country:</div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div>import_vs_export is -1 if India only imports from this country</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>import_vs_export is 0 if India imports/exports equally from this country.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>import_vs_export is -1 if India only exports to this country.</div>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div>(Note that above properties are just indicative - import_vs_export is a continuous field and can have any number
            between -1 and 1. )</div>
        <div>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>I then mapped a diverging colour scale, red-yellow-green, to the ‘import_vs_export’ field to provide a visual idea
            of the trade balance with each country. Thus, if the colour of the country is a dark green, we can infer that
            India mostly exports to that country and if it is dark red, India mostly imports from that country. And if a
            country has a yellow hue, it indicates that there is a balance of trade with that country. For example, we can
            observe that India exports more stuff to the US than it imports from the US. </div>
        <div>
            <br/>

        <div>I chose a map as a glyph to highlight that India trades with almost all regions of the world. Additionally, it is
            interesting to note that even within the same continent, the import/export balance varies a lot across countries.</div>
        <div>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>To make this chart more useful and informative, the tooltip of each country also provides the following information:</div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div>Total import value (million $)</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>Total export value (million $)</div>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>Of course, since this chart focuses on the balance of trade, it does not provide any insight into the actual magnitude
            of the trade. </div>
        <div>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div>
            <u>
                <br/>
            </u>
        </div>
        <div>
            <br/>
